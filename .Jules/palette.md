## 2025-01-24 - Accessibility and Feedback in Email Templates
**Learning:** Email templates in this repository often use icon-only social media links and CTA buttons without hover states. These are critical accessibility and usability gaps.
**Action:** Always check for `aria-label` and `title` on social links and ensure interactive elements have visual hover feedback (like `:hover` transitions).
