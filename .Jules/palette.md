## 2024-07-16 - Added `title` attribute to social media icon links

**Learning:** The email templates in this repository use social media icons in the footer, but the `<a>` tags were missing `title` attributes. This meant that no tooltips appeared on hover, which can be a minor inconvenience for sighted users and a more significant accessibility issue for those who rely on assistive technologies.

**Action:** I have added `title` attributes to the social media icon links in all relevant email templates to improve both UX and accessibility. This is a small but important detail that enhances the user experience, and it's a good practice to follow for all icon-only links.
