## 2024-07-29 - Improving User Flow with External Links
**Learning:** External links in the email templates and main page opened in the same tab, which can be a disruptive user experience. This navigates the user away from their current context, and they might not easily return.
**Action:** I will ensure all external links have `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to open them in a new tab. This preserves the user's current session and provides a smoother, less disruptive experience.
