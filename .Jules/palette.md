## 2024-07-15 - The Power of Descriptive Alt Text in Emails

**Learning:** I discovered that email templates are a prime location for accessibility issues, specifically non-descriptive `alt` text for images. The template I worked on had multiple images (logos, banners, social media icons) with generic `alt` text like "image," which provides no value to users with screen readers.

**Action:** I will make it a priority to audit email templates for `alt` text quality. My future enhancements will focus on providing context-rich descriptions that convey the purpose and meaning of each image, ensuring a more inclusive experience for all users.
